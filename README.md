## Destination Discovery
Travel Planning Made Easy will be a user-friendly travel destination finder that will help reduce stress and eliminate the guesswork from travel planning for future travelers.

## Features
This was to be a web app that allowed individuals to search reviews and select their favorits which would be stored in a database. I had access to the Tripadvisor API but it turned out to be too restrictive so I had to pivot. I found the New York Times articles on Travel which are searchable. Users can search for a city and relevant news about that city will be displayed. 

## Run It Local
Check out the site in action on https://vercel.com/kristinechristensen/mmc6145-final-christensen-kristine

Check back soon, the issue should be resolved.
